# Contributing to HacktoberFest2020

- Check for existing issues and once you've found an issue you'd like to work on, please comment on it and say you're working on that issue. This is to avoid conflicts with others also working on the issue.  
- Write your code, commit with relavant message(such as message containing issue number) and submit your pull request. Wait for code review and address any issues raised as soon as you can.  
- If you want to work on something that there is no GitHub issue for, create a new GitHub issue and propose your change there.
